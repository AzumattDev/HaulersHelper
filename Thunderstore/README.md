# `Description`

> ### A mod that allows you to control the values on carts or things that use the cart script. Supports custom carts.

# `Things to Know`
> It will automatically add config values for any carts that are added to the game.
> 
> Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.
>
> This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client
>
> This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.

# `Features`

> ### This plugin adds several tweakable settings to carts and wagons in the game. Here's what each of the settings do:
>
> ### Detach & Attach Distance
>
> - This setting determines the distance from a cart or wagon that you can attach yourself to it.
>
> ### Attachment Offset
>
> - This setting determines the offset of the attachment point for the cart or wagon.
>
> ### Line Attachment Offset
>
> - This setting determines the offset of the rope attachment point to the connected body for the cart or wagon.
>
> ### Break Force
>
> - This setting determines the amount of force it takes to break the connection to the attachment point for the cart or wagon.
>
> ### Spring
>
> - This setting represents the stiffness of the joint attachment for the cart or wagon. Determines how much the joint will resist being compressed or stretched.
>
> ### Spring Damping
>
> - This setting is used to restrict the distance that the joint can move in a certain direction for the cart or wagon.
>
> ### Base Mass
>
> - This setting determines the mass of the cart or wagon that is calculated as the base. This will allow you to make the cart heavier by default before any weight from the items it stores is calculated.
>
> ### Item Weight Mass Factor
>
> - This setting determines the item weight factor for the cart or wagon. This value is multiplied by the weight of the items in the cart or wagon and added to the base mass. Higher values make it heavier and harder to pull.
>
> ### Min Pitch
>
> - This setting determines the minimum pitch of the cart or wagon's wheel audio.
>
> ### Max Pitch
>
> - This setting determines the maximum pitch of the cart or wagon's wheel audio.
>
> ### Max Pitch Velocity
>
> - This setting determines the maximum velocity of the cart or wagon's wheel audio. This will be the pitch control based on the velocity of the wheel.
>
> ### Max Volume
>
> - This setting determines the maximum volume of the cart or wagon's wheel audio.
>
> ### Max Volume Velocity
>
> - This setting determines the maximum velocity at which the cart or wagon's wheels can play audio at the maximum volume.
>
> ### Audio Change Speed
>
> - This setting determines how quickly the audio volume and pitch can change for the cart or wagon.
